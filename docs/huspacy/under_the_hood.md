# :material-engine-outline: Under the hood

HuSpaCy is built on top of spaCy hence almost all components are part of that NLP framework. Explosion's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ExplosionAI) and [Blog](https://explosion.ai/blog) has several excellent tutorials on the underlying methods.

## Talks, publications
