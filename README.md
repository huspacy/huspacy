# HuSpaCy: Industrial-strength Hungarian NLP

HuSpaCy is a [spaCy](https://spacy.io) model and a library providing industrial-strength Hungarian language processing facilities. 
The released pipeline consists of a tokenizer, sentence splitter, lemmatizer, tagger (predicting morphological features as well), dependency parser and a named entity recognition module. 
Word and phrase embeddings are also available through spaCy's API.
All models have high throughput, decent memory usage and close to state-of-the-art accuracy. 
A live demo is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huspacy/demo), model releases are published to [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_lg). 

This repository contains material to build HuSpaCy's models from the ground up.

## Installation

To get started using the tool, first, you need to do download the model. The easiest way to achieve this is fetch the model by installing the `huspacy` package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install huspacy
```

This utility package exposes convenience methods for downloading and using the latest model:

```python
import huspacy

# Download the latest model
huspacy.download()

# Download the specified model 
huspacy.download(version="v0.4.2")

# Load the previously downloaded model (hu_core_news_lg)
nlp = huspacy.load()
```

Alternatively, one can install the latest model from Hugging Face Hub directly:

```bash
pip install https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_lg/resolve/main/hu_core_news_lg-any-py3-none-any.whl
```

To speed up inference using GPUs, CUDA support can be installed as described in [https://spacy.io/usage](https://spacy.io/usage).

## Usage

HuSpaCy is fully compatible with [spaCy's API](https://spacy.io/api/doc/), newcomers can easily get started using [spaCy 101](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101) guide. 

Although HuSpacy models can be leaded with `spacy.load()`, the tool provides convenience methods to easily access downloaded models.
```python
# Load the model using huspacy
import huspacy
nlp = huspacy.load()

# Load the mode using spacy.load()
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("hu_core_news_lg")

# Load the model directly as a module
import hu_core_news_lg
nlp = hu_core_news_lg.load()

# Either way you get the same model and can start processing texts.
doc = nlp("Csiribiri csiribiri zabszalma - négy csillag közt alszom ma.")
```

## Available Models 

Currently, we provide a single large model which achieves a good balance between accuracy and processing speed. A demo of this model is available at [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huspacy/demo).
This default model ([`hu_core_news_lg`](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_lg)) provides tokenization, sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging (UD labels w/ detailed morphosyntactic features), lemmatization, dependency parsing and named entity recognition and ships with pretrained word vectors.

Models' changes are recorded in the [changelog](https://github.com/huspacy/huspacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Development
 
### Installing requirements

- `poetry install` will install all the dependencies
- For better performance you might need to [reinstall spacy with GPU support](https://spacy.io/usage), e.g. `poetry add spacy[cuda92]` will add support for CUDA 9.2
