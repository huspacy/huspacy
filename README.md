HuSpaCy is a [spaCy](https://spacy.io) library providing industrial-strength Hungarian language processing facilities through spaCy models. 
The released pipelines consist of a tokenizer, sentence splitter, lemmatizer, tagger (predicting morphological features as well), dependency parser and a named entity recognition module. 
Word and phrase embeddings are also available through spaCy's API.
All models have high throughput, decent memory usage and close to state-of-the-art accuracy. 
A live demo is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huspacy/demo), model releases are published to [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/).

This repository contains material to build HuSpaCy and all of its models in a reproducible way.

#  Installation

To get started using the tool, first, we need to download one of the models. The easiest way to achieve this is to install `huspacy` (from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/huspacy/)) and then fetch a model through its API.

```bash
pip install huspacy
```

```python
import huspacy

# Download the latest CPU optimized model
huspacy.download()
```

### Install the models directly

You can install the latest models directly from ü§ó Hugging Face Hub:

- CPU optimized [large model](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_lg): `pip install https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_lg/resolve/main/hu_core_news_lg-any-py3-none-any.whl`
- GPU optimized [transformers model](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_trf): `pip install https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_trf/resolve/main/hu_core_news_trf-any-py3-none-any.whl`

To speed up inference on GPUs, CUDA should be installed as described in [https://spacy.io/usage](https://spacy.io/usage).

Read more on the models [here](/models)

#  Quickstart
HuSpaCy is fully compatible with [spaCy's API](https://spacy.io/api/doc/), newcomers can easily get started with [spaCy 101](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101) guide.

Although HuSpacy models can be loaded with `spacy.load(...)`, the tool provides convenience methods to easily access downloaded models.

```python
# Load the model using spacy.load(...)
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("hu_core_news_lg")
```

```python
# Load the default large model (if downloaded)
import huspacy
nlp = huspacy.load()
```

```python
# Load the model directly as a module
import hu_core_news_lg
nlp = hu_core_news_lg.load()
```

To process texts, you can simply call the loaded model (i.e. the [`nlp` callable object](https://spacy.io/api/language#call)) 

```python
doc = nlp("Csiribiri csiribiri zabszalma - n√©gy csillag k√∂zt alszom ma.")
```

As HuSpaCy is built on spaCy, the returned [`doc` document](https://spacy.io/api/doc#_title) contains all the annotations given by the pipeline components.

API Documentation is available in [our website](https://huspacy.github.io/).

#  Models overview

We provide several pretrained models:

 1. [`hu_core_news_lg`](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_lg) is a CNN-based large model which achieves a good balance between accuracy and processing speed. This default model provides tokenization, sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging (UD labels w/ detailed morphosyntactic features), lemmatization, dependency parsing and named entity recognition and ships with pretrained word vectors.
2. [`hu_core_news_trf`](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_trf) is built on [huBERT](https://huggingface.co/SZTAKI-HLT/hubert-base-cc) and provides the same functionality as the large model except the word vectors. It comes with much higher accuracy in the price of increased computational resource usage. We suggest using it with GPU support. 
3. [`hu_core_news_md`](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_md) greatly improves on `hu_core_news_lg`'s throughput by loosing some accuracy. This model could be a good choice when processing speed is crucial.

HuSpaCy's model versions follows [spaCy's versioning scheme](https://spacy.io/models#model-versioning).

A demo of the models is available at [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huspacy/demo).

To read more about the model's architecture we suggest reading [the relevant sections from spaCy's documentation](https://spacy.io/models#design).
