The model builds on the [Hungarian UD treebank](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Hungarian-Szeged) and the [NerKor corpus](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Hungarian-Szeged), thus it is capable of predicting PoS and morphological tags, computing lemmata, providing dependency parses of sentences and marking named entities. The underlying transformer model is backed by [XLM-RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-large).
